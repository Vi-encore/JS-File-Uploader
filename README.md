# JS-File-Uploader

Simple JS File Uploader. 
Done with help of this tutorial: https://www.codingnepalweb.com/file-upload-with-progress-bar-html-javascript/ . 
I added Drag&Drop feature and imitation of loading, which depends of your internet-connection. 
I used Navigator API (which is built), to find data about internet connection. 


#Better working on localServer, cause here pages throws 405 error (http request probs).
#I don't know PHP, so I don't know, how to fix it. Sorry
